option #1 O((n-m)*m)
    Slide a size of m*l window on S, check to see if all words in dictionary contain in this window.

Option #2 O(n)
    Use "Minimum Window Substring" approach. There will be 'l' (length of single word in dictionary) iterations,
as we need to take care of offset cases. But, since we'll process on word, total steps are (n/l). Overall complexity
is still O(n).

Need BFS, as there will be stack overflow when the input is a big matrix.
Add all 'O' to queue from four edges, after search done flip those unvisited 'O' to 'X'
'visited' table can be avoided. 'visited' flag can mark on source matrix itself as '$', or so. After search, replace
all 'O' to 'X', and all '$' to 'O'.

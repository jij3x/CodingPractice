Maintain a stack for '(' positions, and a 'last' pointer for last INVALID parentheses' position.

In case of '))((())'
             ^ ^^^
             L 12c

Valid parentheses length is from top element '1' in stack to 'c'.
    '2' will be popped first, when 'c' become current
    we don't need 'last' pointer to calculate valid () length


In case of concatenation '))()()'
                           ^  ^^
                           L  1c

    We need 'last' point to calculate valid parentheses length in this case
    this case happens when stack is empty
    'last' pointer will move only when stack is empty and ')' still coming along

Maintain a stack for '(' positions, and a 'last' pointer for last INVALID parentheses' position.

In case of containing '))((())'
                        ^ ^^^
                        L 12c

Valid parentheses length is from stack bottom ('1') to 'c' -
    when 'c' become current, '2' will be popped first
    we don't use 'last' pointer to calculate valid () length in this caes


In case of concatenation '))()()'
                           ^  ^^
                           L  1c

    We need 'last' point to calculate valid parentheses length
    this case happens when stack is empty
    'last' pointer will move only when stack is empty and ')' still coming along

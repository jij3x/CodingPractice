need implement customized comparator for ArrayList<Interval> comparison - 
    class intervalComparator implements Comparator<Interval> {
        public int compare(Interval i1, Interval i2) {
            // DON'T do 'return i1.start - i2.start', since it might overflow!
            return i1.start == i2.start ? 0 : (i1.start > i2.start ? 1 : -1);
        }
    }
    
sort the intervals first: Collections.sort(intervals, new intervalComparator ())
maintain a prev and curr pointer, if no overlap add prev to result and prev point to curr and repeat
    if overlap update the prev interval (no op on curr pointer in this case) and repeat

need to make use of array index
    scan the array from begin towards end
        for current position 'i', try to swap the content in the right place (if target index exists)
        keep swapping until can't swap any more, this is to ensure number in 'i' postion is not swappable
            before move on to the next index.
    last, scan altered array once again, find first position where number is not relevent to the index.
    !!!! in case of empty array, or, array already contains 1...n numbers, return the length+1

special cases: [] -> 1, [0] -> 1, [1] -> 2, [2] -> 1, [100, 200, 300] -> 1

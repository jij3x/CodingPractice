Dual DP problem

Transitive Function:
    F(n) = min(F(i-1) + 1);
        F(n) means minimum cuts in S(0,n)
        0 <= i <= n, and, S(i,n) is palindrome
        F(-1) = 0; meaning S(0,n) is a prlindrome

Find all palindrome sub-strings is also an DP problem.

Another option is to find short distance (using BFS) in palindrome table.

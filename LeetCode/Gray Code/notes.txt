 (x) -> 001 -+
        010  |
        011  |
        100  |
        101  |
 (y) -> 110 -+
        111

1. Bits in x and y are all different (x = ~y)
        which means x^(x>>1) and y^(y>>1) only differ on 1st bit (prefix)
            abcdefgh          ABCDEFGH
            (xor)       vs.   (xor)
            0abcdefg          0ABCDEFG         (a = ~A, b = ~B .....)

2. While x and y's gray code also only differ on 1st bit (reflect prefix)

3. Therefore, n's gray code is: n^(n>>1)

Maintain "minPrice" and "maxProfit"
During the price list scan, update minPice, and maxProfit (current profit is prices[i] - minPrice).
Idea is - minPrice will potentially lead to maxProfit, but maxProfit not necessary base on minPrice because highest
price could happened before the minPrice appear.

Watch out empty price list.

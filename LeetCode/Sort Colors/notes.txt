Will need 3 pointers: one for redAfter, one for blueBefore, the other for scan pivot.

scan pivot will start from 0, towards blueBefore. During the scan, there are 3 situation:
    1. meet red, swap with redAfter, and advance pivot
    2. meet blue, swap with blueBefore
    3. meet white, advance pivot

relation between scan pivot and redAfter: all elements before redAfter should be red, all elements between scan pivot
    and redAfter should be white, or, all red (if all red, means scan pivot is same as redAfter)
relation between scan pivot and blueBefore: all elements need to be processed.

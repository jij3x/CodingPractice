'I' is distiance from begining to the loop start node
'C' is loop's length
when 1-step cursor at the start node of loop, 2-step cursor is ahead of 'I'
assume after 'N' steps they meet... 2-step cursor traveled '2N'
so... I+2N-xC=N -> N=xC-I
Second time they meet, loop start node will be 'I' steps ahead

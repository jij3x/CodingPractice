'I' is distiance from begining to the loop start node
'C' is loop's length

when 1-step cursor at the start node of loop, 2-step cursor is ahead of 'I'
assume after 'N' steps they meet... 2-step cursor traveled '2N'

so...   (I + 2N) % C = N % C
    =>  (I + 2N) - xC = N - yC
    =>  I + N = (x - y)C
    =>  N = (x-y)C - I
Second time they meet, loop start node will be 'I' steps ahead

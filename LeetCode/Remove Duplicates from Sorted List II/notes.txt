Need a safe guard in front, since head could be removed.
maintain two pointers: prev and pivot (prev.next initially point to pivot).
for each iteration, pivot will go all the way to the end of duplicates, if no duplicate, pivot won't move
    after pivot settled, check to see if pivot moved (see if prev still points to it)
    if moved, pivot advance, prev point to pivot.
    if not moved, both pivot and prev advance.

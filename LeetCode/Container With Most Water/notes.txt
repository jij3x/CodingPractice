Define a window (head, and end), initially covers the show array. Calculate the water could be contained by these two
edges, and shrink this window, calculate again and update the Max.
As head and end go closer, the larger volume of water will happen only when height of edges raise (because width is
 losing). So, the shrink stretegy is move the shorter bar only.

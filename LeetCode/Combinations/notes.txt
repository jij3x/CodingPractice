Combination problem - to generate all combinations...
    C(n,k) = P(n,k)/P(k,k)
    Example: C(4,2) = (4!/2!)/2! = 6

Don't need a seperate recursive function (with start pointer), as we can start from 'n' to 1.
Bit complication on base case: need to avoid using if (k==n). Using if (k==1) will do the same thing, plus, it will
    stop k go below 0.

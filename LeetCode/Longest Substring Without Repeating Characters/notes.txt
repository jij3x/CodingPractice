maintain two pointers, and a HashMap
scan the string, once dectect a dupicated char, find the previous position, and start from there
update the maxLength during the scan... using distance between two pointers

example:
    abcdefgchijklmn
      ^*   ^*
once detect duplicated 'c', start process from 'd' (not from 'h').

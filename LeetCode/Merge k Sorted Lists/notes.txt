In mergesort solution, each original list has been touched O(log(k)) times, where k is the number of lists.
That said, each node has been touched O(log(k)) times. So the total running time is O(nlog(k)), where n is 
the total number of nodes. Note that, for odd cases, as shown above, some list(s) may be touched more 
than log(k) times, but still O(log(k)) times.

HeapSort Solution - 
* Build up a min heap of the k head nodes of given lists.
* Take the smallest one (i.e. the head of min heap) and add its next to heap.
* Repeat until all nodes in lists have been merged into one list.

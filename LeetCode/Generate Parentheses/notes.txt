DFS, recursive function will have 4 params - left/right parentheses counts, constructed string, result set
    base case is when right parenthses are used up
    if still have some left parentheses, append one '(' to the 'constructed string' and recursivly traverse down
    if right parentheses count greater than lefts', append one ')' and recursively traverse down
        (right parentheses can't be more than left parentheses, since it will leed to syntax error.)

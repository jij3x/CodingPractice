Need generate two max profit tables first:
    one is for transactions happen before (and include) ith
    another is for transactions happen before (and include) ith

Final result is the max of leftMax[i] + rightMax[i+1].
Also, one transaction max profit is also possible: leftMax[last] (or rigthMax[first]) needs to be taken into account.

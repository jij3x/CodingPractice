A peak element is an element that is greater than its neighbors.

Given an input array where num[i] ¡Ù num[i+1], find a peak element and return its index.

You may imagine that num[-1] = num[n] = -Infinity.

For example, in array [1, 2, 3, 1], 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.

Note:
Your solution should be in logarithmic complexity.

Basic idea is to start from each station and check wether a car can finish the circular route. O(n^2)

One discover is:
If a car starts from station 0 and cannot go further on station i, then, station 0 to i won't be qualified as a
start point. Because after the car trave from station 0 to station j (0>j>i), it will have at least 0 gas. So, if
a car cannot reach to station i+1 (from station 0), it cannot start from station j drive to station i+1.

With this discover, we can skip checking station 0...i-1, if a car will stuck in station i. This bring the
solution to O(n).


Otimization: whether a car can finish the circule is determined by total gas from all stations, and, total cost
from all path. Total gas greater than total cost makes it possible for car to complete the circule. 
And because there is only one possilbe start point, the end point should be the station with max accumated gas debt
along the route.

same as hand math
    Maintain an int array (length would be num1.length() + num2.length())
    Go through each pair of digits, NOTE: ith and jth pair shoul be in (i+j+1)th position of final product
    The position for final carry from each round is quite tricky!
    
    Also, special cases: 0*0, 10*0

option 1: dynamic programming -> p(i,j) = S(i)==S(j) && p(i+1,j-1)
    maintain a 2D boolean table (memo) to store p(i,j) .....O(n^2) and space O(n^2)

option 2: have a p(i,s) function to return max lenght of palindromic string centered at ith position. and let i go
    through the whole string.  p(i,s) will need to handle two cases: 1.center itself;
    2.center' between center and center+1

     1     ....row #0
    1,1    ....row #1
   1,2,1   ....row #2
  1,3,3,1  ....row #3
 1,4,6,4,1 ....row #4

one way is maintain two rows: one for previous, another for current... both have row #0 as initial row, and loop start
    from row #1

another way is have one row, expanding from middle. For example, if we need row #4, will have 1 in middle first...
    then 2,1... then 3,3,1... then 4,6,4,1. Will have to prefill '1' in 1st element.

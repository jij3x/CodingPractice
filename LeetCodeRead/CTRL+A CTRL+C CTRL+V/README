Imagine you have a special keyboard with the following keys:

A
Ctrl+A
Ctrl+C
Ctrl+V
where CTRL+A, CTRL+C, CTRL+V each acts as one function key for ¡°Select All¡±, ¡°Copy¡±, and ¡°Paste¡± operations respectively.

If you can only press the keyboard for N times (with the above four keys), please write a program to produce maximum numbers of A. If possible, please also print out the sequence of keys.

That is to say, the input parameter is N (No. of keys that you can press), the output is M (No. of As that you can produce).

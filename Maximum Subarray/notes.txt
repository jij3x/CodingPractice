DP solution: (Kadane's algorithm)

maintain two variables during the one round scan - "max", and, "sum"
    max for max sum of sub-array
    sum for sum of window end with 'i'
        during table scan, window will be adjusted base on previous window sum:
            if previous window sum < 0, new winodw will start with A[i]
            else expand window to incorperate A[i] (sum += A[i])

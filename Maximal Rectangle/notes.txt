An 'hanging line' must be existing in the maximal rectangle ('hanging line' is a vertical line contains only '1')
    will have three 1D arraies... one for height, one for left (how far left hanging line can expand to),
    another for right (how far right...)

transitive function:
    when point(x,y) is '1'
        height(x,y) = height(x,y-1) + 1
        left(x,y) = max(left(x,y-1), count of consecutive '1's from x towards left end)
        right(x,y) = max(right(x,y-1), count of consecutive '1's from x towards right end)
    when point(x,y) is '0'
        height(x,y) = 0
        left(x,y) = 0
        right(x,y) = 0

Option #1: DP

Option #2: Greedy
Look s as P1*P2*...Pn, or, *P1*P2*...Pn, or, P1*P2*...Pn*. 
Try to find all patterns in s (follow the sequence as these patterns show up in p). For example, 
(s=ababzzabcdcdabcdefef, p=ab*cd*ef) will have an inital match ([ab]abzzab[cd]cdabcd[ef]ef). No worry on chars among
initial matched groups, since wild card will absorb them.
After initial match, need to look out for:
    1. still something remaining in s. In this case, need to match last pattern with s' tail (only if * shown before!)
    2. still something remaining in p. In this case, need to check if all remaining in p is wildcard '*'.

special cases:
    s=abab, p=ab (no wildcard, and it has to be exact match)
    s=abcdef, p=ab*cd
    s=ab, p=ab*ab

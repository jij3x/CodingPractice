Find k closest elements to a given value
Given a sorted array arr[] and a value X, find the k closest elements to X in arr[]. 

Examples:

Input: K = 4, X = 35
       arr[] = {12, 16, 22, 30, 35, 39, 42, 45, 48, 50, 53, 55, 56}

Output: 30 39 42 45

Note that if the element is present in array, then it should not be in output, only the other closest elements are required.

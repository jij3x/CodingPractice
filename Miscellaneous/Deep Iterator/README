Write a deep iterator to iterate through a list of objects or integer which could be another list or integer. This is frequently asked by LinkedIn, Twitter and Hulu. 

For example, this collection contains Integer or another collection. L means it is a collection that contains either integer or another L. 

                         + -> 5
                         |
          + -> 3 -> 4 -> L -> 6
          |
1 -> 2 -> L -> 7-> 8

We would expect an iterator to loop through it will print out 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8

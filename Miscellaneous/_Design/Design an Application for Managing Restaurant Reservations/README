You are the owner of a software company. A restaurant owner approaches you with a request to design an application for managing restaurant reservations. The restaurant has one location only, and takes reservations by phone. Reservations include name and phone of customer, date and time requested, and size of party. Reservations are confirmed on the spot if there is availability. Design an OO application for this reservation system. This is a design question, no coding required. Enumerate the classes you will build for such system. Express your answer in bullet points. For each class, describe its intent, and its relation to other classes in your design. You may add method signatures to the design if you think this will clarify the design more. Your design will be evaluated on OO design principles.
